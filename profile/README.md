# TWRP development for T11x

## Bring it on.

Samsung and other companies have long since used closed-source software, even not releasing source after the device is abandoned *(no future sales or support)*.

This is done intentionally to bring more sales to newer -and more expensive- devices. This creates e-waste, and hurts the environment as much as the customer.

We approximately have around 347 million metric tonnes of e-waste on Earth, and that number increases every year. And it will continue to be this way until we do something.

The point of this project is to bring life to old devices (in this case the Tab 3 Lite), which manufacturers don't care about supporting anymore.

Thanks for caring about the environment. :heart: :seedling:
